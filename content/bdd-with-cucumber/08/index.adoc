== Example Mapping

shot::[1, "Animation of Matt talking to camera"]

In the last lesson we saw how easily incidental details can creep into your scenarios, talked about why theyâ€™re a problem, and showed you some techniques for massaging them back out again.
But, as we pushed the details out of our scenarios, we made the step definition code more complicated. We promised to show you how to deal with that extra complexity, and we're going to get to that in the next chapter, Chapter 9.

First though, we want to look at how we could have prevented the Premium Accounts feature from getting into such a mess in the first place.

We're going to learn about a practice called Example Mapping, a way to structure the conversation between the _Three Amigos_ - Tester, Developer and Product Owner - to develop shared understanding before you write any code.
