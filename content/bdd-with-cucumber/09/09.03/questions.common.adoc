==== Lesson 4 - Questions

===== Why do we run the unit tests before the acceptance tests?

* If the unit tests are failing, there's no way the acceptance tests will pass (*Correct*)
* Unit tests are better than acceptance tests
* Acceptance tests are always faster so we leave them until the end

Explanation:

We've heard it said that acceptance tests help you build the right thing, and unit tests help you build the thing right. We run the unit tests first to get feedback about whether the pieces of our solution (the _units_) are fundamentally working. Then, if they are, we can find out whether they play together to deliver the overall system behaviour that we're looking for.
