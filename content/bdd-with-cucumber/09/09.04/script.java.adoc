We need a new class to contain our support code. Let’s create a class called `ShoutSupport` in the same package as our step definitions.

We already have a shout method in our step definition class. Let’s cut that method and paste it into to the support class. We’ll make it public and rename it to `seanShout`. 

We also need the two maps - `people` and `messagesShoutedBy`. Let’s cut and paste those as well. We’ll instantiate these maps where they are declared, and declare them `public` and `final`.

Now that we have a new `ShoutSupport` class let’s put it to use in our step definitions. We’ll declare a constructor to pass it in, store the reference in a `shoutSupport` field and call this method everywhere we used to call `shout`.

Since our maps are now moved, we need to access those from the `shoutSupport` object as well.

Cucumber now fails with an error complaining that the `Stepdefs` class doesn’t have an empty constructor. You may not have given it much thought, but Cucumber creates a new instance of every class with step definitions before every scenario.

Cucumber knows how to instantiate classes with empty constructors. When the classes expect dependencies to be passed in, Cucumber needs to delegate the instantiation of objects to a dependency injection container.

Cucumber supports half a dozen dependency injection containers. Let’s pick a simple one that doesn’t require any configuration - picocontainer.

[Adds PicoContainer to the pom.xml]

Now that Cucumber successfully instantiates the objects, let’s finish our refactoring. We’ll know that we’re done when all scenarios are green again.
