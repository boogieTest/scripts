Up until now, we've been running Cucumber every time we make a change in order to follow the TDD process. When we find a change that's too specific to a particular domain model, we usually drop down to the specs for that model and run them individually, again, following the TDD loop.

But, while reworking the code for this lesson, we found out something that we didn't expect. Our specs were failing, and we didn't actually notice shot::[1]

This was caused by the fact that we were mostly running cucumber and we hadn't run the specs in a long while.

After dedicating some time to fix the specs shot::[2]

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec rspec
..........

Finished in 0.00913 seconds (files took 0.10673 seconds to load)
10 examples, 0 failures
----

we decided to solve this problem by creating a strategy for running all of our test cases, including both specs and scenarios. This way, we could keep a closer look on the big picture.

In order to do so, we created a `Rakefile` shot::[3]

[source,sh]
----
$ touch Rakefile
----

In it, we first added a command to run rspec shot::[4], followed by one to run cucumber. shot::[5]

[source,ruby]
----
task :default do
  sh "bundle exec rspec"
  sh "bundle exec cucumber"
end
----

This works, shot::[6] except for two small nitpicks:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec rake
bundle exec rspec

The first one is the length of that output. At this point we don't need this level of detail, we just want to know everything worked. And to focus on that, there's no better solution than the `progress` formatter. shot::[7]

Great, that's ... shorter. But we still see our failing spec, the one we're in the middle of fixing. That's our second nitpick. We don't want to see unfinished work, we only want to know we haven't broken anything that was already working before.

If we take a pick at the failing scenario, we can see that it has the `@todo` tag.shot::[9] It seems that our team is using that tag as a convention to express that the scenarios marked as `@todo` are a Work in Progress. So lets omit this tag from our output. shot::[10]

[source,ruby]
----
task :default do
  sh "bundle exec rspec"
  sh "bundle exec cucumber --tags 'not @todo' --format progress"

Now, whenever we run our default rake task, we're only checking our actual finished work. shot::[]
